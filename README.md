# TemplateFRCRepo

This repo is a template FRC to assist in creating an FRC repo and how it works. You can anyways create the boilerplate using the WPILib Visual Studio Code, but there are some added functionality that need to be added (e.g motor controller / encoder functionality, pose estimation, path generation), that does not come with the boiler plate.

This repo will assist in implementing Pathplanner (fine-tuning PIDs in real-time using Ziegler-Nichols Test), Motor Controllers, creating commands and subsystems, and autonomous routines.

Notes will be in comments

You know how to clone this repo, and DO NOT PUSH THIS TO THE REMOTE REPO, this is individual, so pushing to origin is not allowed.

Treat this as a study guide, FRC Comp season is coming up, and that will be the test (ik ts corny js let me be).

Btw 10% of coding is theory, the rest 90% is figuring stuff out.
